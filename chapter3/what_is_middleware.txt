# From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2256569/what-is-rack-middleware

Rack middleware is more than "a way to filter a request and response"
- it's an implementation of the pipeline design pattern for web
servers using Rack.

It very cleanly separates out the different stages of processing a
request - separation of concerns being a key goal of all well
designed software products.



For example with Rack I can have separate stages of the pipeline
doing

Authentication - when the request arrives, are the users logon
details correct? How do I validate this OAuth, HTTP Basic Authentication,
name/password?

Authorisation - is the user authorised to perform this particular
task i.e. role-based security

Caching - have I processed this request already, can I return a
cached result?

Decoration - how can I enhance the request to make downstream
processing better

Performance & Usage Monitoring - what stats can I get from the
request & response?

Execution - actually handle the request and provide a response

Being able to separate the different stages (and optionally include
them) is a great help in developing well structured applications

There's also a great eco-system developing around Rack Middleware
- you should be able to find pre-built rack components to do all
of the steps above and more see here


What's middleware?

Middleware is a dreadful term which refers to any software
component/library which assists with but is not directly involved
in the execution of some task. Very common examples are logging,
authentication and the other common, horizontal processing components.
These tend to be the things that everyone needs across multiple
applications but not too many people are interested (or should be)
in building themselves.
